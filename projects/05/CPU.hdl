/**
 * The Hack CPU (Central Processing unit), consisting of an ALU,
 * two registers named A and D, and a program counter named PC.
 * The CPU is designed to fetch and execute instructions written in 
 * the Hack machine language. In particular, functions as follows:
 * Executes the inputted instruction according to the Hack machine 
 * language specification. The D and A in the language specification
 * refer to CPU-resident registers, while M refers to the external
 * memory location addressed by A, i.e. to Memory[A]. The inM input 
 * holds the value of this location. If the current instruction needs 
 * to write a value to M, the value is placed in outM, the address 
 * of the target location is placed in the addressM output, and the 
 * writeM control bit is asserted. (When writeM==0, any value may 
 * appear in outM). The outM and writeM outputs are combinational: 
 * they are affected instantaneously by the execution of the current 
 * instruction. The addressM and pc outputs are clocked: although they 
 * are affected by the execution of the current instruction, they commit 
 * to their new values only in the next time step. If reset==1 then the 
 * CPU jumps to address 0 (i.e. pc is set to 0 in next time step) rather 
 * than to the address resulting from executing the current instruction. 
 *
 *  instruction[0] 	  --> A or C-instruction
 *  instruction[1..2] --> Unused
 *  instruction[3]	  --> Affecting A or M register
 *  instruction[4..9] --> Correspond to ALU control bits
 *  instruction[10]   --> Write to A
 *  instruction[11]	  --> Write to D
 *  instruction[12]	  --> Write to M
 *  instruction[13]	  --> Jmp is out < 0
 *  instruction[14]	  --> Jmp is out = 0  these use ng and zr from ALU
 *  instruction[15]	  --> Jmp is out > 0
 *
 * 
 * TO DO:
 *   - Implement jmps via the jmp bits and ng/zr outputs from ALU
 *     into the load and inc control bits of the PC
 *   - Determine whether to write ALU output to M via outM from the
 *     writeM control bit value (instruction[12])
 *        - outM may equal any value when writeM == 0
 *	 - This Chip is coded backwards-- needs to be fixed.
 *   	  - Bits are labeled as such: 
 *     		001 --> bit[0]=1, bit[1]=0, bit[2]=0
 *
