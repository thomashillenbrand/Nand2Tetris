# Nand2Tetris

This is the code produced by myself thru the Nand2Tetris course/Tutorial.

Each of the 2 courses will have its own folder. A third tolfder will be kept with any extra-curricular files that were created, sed, studied for this course.

I entered this project with a few years of software development and coding experience, but almost zero knowledge about computer engineering, assembly code, or OS design/development.
