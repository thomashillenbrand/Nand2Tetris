# Nand2Tetris

This repository contains all the code for my completion of the nand2tetris course (www.nand2tetris.org)

## Part 1: Hardware

Projects 01 thru 06 deal with the hardware components of the HACK computer.

### Project 01: Boolean Logic
This project is meant to introduce you to the concept of logic gates and to construct all basic logic gates (Not, And, Or, Xor, Mux, Dmux, etc.) via HDL needed to implement a computer machine.

### Project 02: Boolean Arithmetic and the ALU
This project is meant to build all the requisite chips needed for an Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU), including a HalfAdder, FullAdder, and Incrementor from the basic and composite gates constructed in Project 01.

### Project 03: Memory
This project is meant to construct all the chips needed to build a Random Access Memory Unit (RAM), including a Bit, Register, Program Counter, and eventually a RAM16K (16384-register memory).

### Project 04: Machine Language
This project is meant to get a taste of low-level programming in machine language, and to get acquainted with the Hack computer platform. In the process of working on this project, you will become familiar with the assembly process - translating from symbolic language to machine-language - and you will appreciate visually how native binary code executes on the target hardware platform. These lessons will be learned in the context of writing and testing two low-level programs Mult.asm, and Fill.asm.

### Project 05: Computer Architecture
This project is meant to introduce you to the architecture of a modern computer, based on Vonn Neumann. You will complete the construction o the HACK CPU and computer platform by combining previously constructed chips.

### Project 06: Assembler
This project is meant to teach you about the actual act of assembling machine language into binary code. In this project you will implement an Assembler in a high-level programming language (I used Java) that can translate .asm files into HACK binary code.

## Part 2: Software

Projects 07 thru 13 deal with the software components of the HACK computer.

### Project 07 & 08: The VMTranslator
### Project 09: High Level Language
### Project 10 & 11: The Compiler
### Project 12: The Operating System
### Project 13: Further Work
