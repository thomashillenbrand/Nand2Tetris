# Nand2Tetris

This is the code produced by myself thru the Nand2Tetris course/tutorial.

I entered this project with a few years of software development and coding experience, but almost zero knowledge about computer engineering, assembly code, or OS design/development.

The goal of this course was to understand computers at a more fundamental level.
